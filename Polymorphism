- Deals with how the program decides which method it should use, depending on what type of thing it has.

Example: 
Person has a "read" method.
Student has its own "read" method. 
At runtime, you decided which one gets called. 

Person p = new Student();
p.read();

The "read" method in Student gets called. 

Student IS A Person
