- Encapsulation makes the fields in a class private, and provide access to the fields via public methods. 

AKA "Data hiding"

- If a field is private in a class, it cannot be accessed outside the class.

- Main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code (when other people are coding).
It gives maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility to our code.
